# Quitter #

#### Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNzEbubeBMA&ab_channel=JohnRichardEspedal

This project is an android app with the purpose of helping people quit smoking.  
It was initially inspired by the app "Slutta" made by the Norwegian Directorate of Health. 

I myself have previously used "Slutta" and seen room for improvement.  
This is my attempt at implementing those improvements in a new app.

The core functionalities of the app:
1. A timer that persistently keeps track of how long you've gone without smoking.
2. A Craving button that the user can click when they have the urge to smoke which sends them to the New York Times' games/puzzles section.
3. An achievements page which keeps track of all previously earned milestones, such as "24 hours" without smokes, "1 week" etc.
4. A settings menu which in its current state only allows the user to change from light mode to dark mode.
