# Quitter #
This project is an android app with the purpose of helping people quit smoking.  
It was initially inspired by the app "Slutta" made by the Norwegian Directorate of Health. 

I myself have previously used "Slutta" and seen room for improvement.  
This is my attempt at implementing those improvements in a new app.
